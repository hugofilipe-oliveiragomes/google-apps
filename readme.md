# Google App Store Data Analysis


### Overview
This project is part of the Ironhack weekly project for Week 4, focusing on data analysis.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset from the Google Play Store to understand how specific characteristics can impact an app's popularity. By examining factors such as app size, pricing, ratings, and number of installs, we aim to provide insights that can guide strategies for optimal app development and market success.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle at the following link:

### Analysis - Hypotheses
We formulated the following null hypotheses to test our assumptions:

Free vs. Paid Apps: The majority of the apps are not free.
App Size vs. Rating: The size of the app does not influence the rating.
App Size vs. Number of Installs: The size of the app does not influence the number of installs.
App Rating vs. Number of Installs: Apps with more installs donâ€™t have higher ratings.

### Results
Our analysis found connections between different factors and app popularity on the Google Play Store, leading us to reject all four null hypotheses. However, some relationships may be weaker than others, showing that the influence varies. To fully understand these connections and provide useful insights for app developers and stakeholders, more investigation is needed.
